;; Project Euler - Problem 6
;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
;; numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
;;
;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
;; natural numbers and the square of the sum.
